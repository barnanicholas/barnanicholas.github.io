            My name is Nicholas Heinrich-Barna, and I am a first-year PhD candidate. I graduated in the spring of 2023 from TAMU with a double major in Computer Engineering and Petroleum Engineering. When I first entered university, I knew only broadly that I wanted to do something with math. Engineering seemed like a good choice, a broad field with numerous possibilities. Like most, it was during the course of my undergraduate studies that I honed in on my passion.<br>
            By navigating two degrees, I began to see all disciplines as a collection of interconnected systems. From typical computer programming to drilling engineering, I had the advantage of learning a large breadth of materials. Over time, I began to see patterns arise in all of my engineering classes. These patterns let me see the world of engineering less as separate distinct disciplines and more as interconnected systems wherein the decisions made in one area could affect the outcomes in a completely separate area. By evaluating these relationships, I began to believe these connections were a potential site for malpractice and malfeasance. This realization was pivotal in leading me to one of the most vital and influential industries today: Cyber Security

        <h2>Current Research</h2>
        <p>Modern embedded systems, vital across industries like healthcare, transportation, and communication, heavily depend on hardware as the root of trust. Commercial products from industry giants like Intel, AMD, TI, and ARM are central to these systems. However, the increasing complexity of hardware designs has given rise to security-critical vulnerabilities that disrupt conventional threat models. Cross-layer attacks, which exploit both hardware and software, pose significant threats.
        To address this challenge, I propose the development of a hybrid hardware verification framework called VeriFuzz. This framework aims to combine the strengths of formal verification and hardware fuzzing to efficiently detect and mitigate security vulnerabilities in complex embedded systems, such as modern processors.</p>

                Currently, I work on security assurance of industrial control sys-
                tems. I primarily utilize fuzzing; however, instead of simulating hardware, I utilize
                custom-made firmware and drivers to access peripherals directly. Previously, I designed and
                tested verification techniques to be used on open-source processors; primarily fuzzing
                simulated hardware.

                I worked
                on exploiting firmware vulnerabilities on embedded systems. I primarily focused on
                reversing firmware binaries to find bugs that can be turned into DOS exploits

                I built a decen-

                tic stack, alongside TIKA, and other custom-made tools.
